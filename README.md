# Movie Jar

Picking a movie to watch is too hard. This app makes a random selection from an AnyList.

## Usage

Sign up for an AnyList account and create a list where you'll add movies you might want to watch in the future.

Make a copy of `.env.sample` called `.env` and fill in your AnyList credentials.

## Run the app locally

Run `nodemon app.js` and view the app at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
